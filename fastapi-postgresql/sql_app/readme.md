## Run the code
**Option 1**:
cd to folder `fastapi-postgresql`, then run `uvicorn sql_app.main:app --reload`
**Option 2**:
cd to folder `sql_app`, change all `from . import xxx` to `import xxx`, then run `uvicorn main:app --reload`
<br>
Where `main` is the file name(`sql_app.`with src), `app` is the name of app variable and `â€” reload` will restart server anytime when make a change to the code and should only be used in development.
